docker - A Vagrant Machine
==========================

This repository contains the blueprints for building a Docker
environment as a Vagrant (Virtualbox) machine image, to make it
easy to `vagrant up` and Docker away!

Using `jhunt/docker`
--------------------

You don't even _need_ this repository for that!

```
mkdir -p ~/local/docker
cd ~/local/docker
vagrant init jhunt/docker
vagrant up
```

And you're good to go!
